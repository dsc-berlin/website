Join DSC Berlin in flooding the web with colorful pixels! 

<!--more-->

Pixelflut is a large screen where you can draw whatever you want, one pixel at a
time!

We will host a webserver, to which you can send coloring commands using the
specified protocol. We are going to use a common pixelflut implementation,
similar to the [original](https://cccgoe.de/wiki/Pixelflut).
